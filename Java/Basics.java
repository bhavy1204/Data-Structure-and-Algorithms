//This is an Absolute beginners guide if you have any experience with JAVA i suggest to skip to other lessons.

//JAVA is a pure Object oriented language
//In a typical java program everything is written inside a class which has same name as of the file.

//We will cover the concept of Package in later Programs. For now consider as it is the name of the folder in which the Files are written... In this case "Java".

//PROGRAM 1 : Java Program to print Hello World
// package Java;
// public class Basics {
//     public static void main(String[] args) {
//         System.out.println("Simple java program");
//     }
// }
